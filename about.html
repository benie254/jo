    <h2>Any toys for Jo?</h2>
    <p>Naah. I have never found toys any interesting. But I like the idea of distracting the mind, or challenging it. When I'm bored, anything within reach is like a toy. That is perhaps the one time I feel like a baby and do not mind it. It's okay. Pass the time. It'll be okay</p>
