    <h1>I am Jo</h1>
    <p>I believe you already know me. Thank you for sparing your time to read with Jo. This blog has tons of interesting stories for every and any season or occasion. Join me!</p>
    <h3>Jane</h3>
    <p>When I was two, I met this girl, Jane. I liked her. I still do. We do not meet often, though. Her owners let her out in the evenings; mine let me out in the morning. We always have only a little time before she is or I am locked up. I hope to raise a family with Jane, someday. Someday.</p>
    <h2>Any toys for Jo?</h2>
    <p>Naah. I have never found toys any interesting. But I like the idea of distracting the mind, or challenging it. When I'm bored, anything within reach is like a toy. That is perhaps the one time I feel like a baby and do not mind it. It's okay. Pass the time. It'll be okay</p>
