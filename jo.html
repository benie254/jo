    <title>Welcome to Jo's Chennel!</title>

    <h1>Hello, I am Jo. Nice of you to visit!</h1>
    <h2>Wanna know a little more about me?</h2>
    <p>
      My old man named me Jo. I am three years old. Among us canines, that's an average youth. I like to think of myself as sociable and playful. I have also packed some energy in my hinds and fores. It's why they call me the German Shepherd.
    </p>
    <h3>Jane</h3>
    <p>
      When I was two, I met this girl, Jane. I liked her. I still do. We do not see each other often, though. See, her folks let her out in the evenings; mine let me out in the morning. We always have only a little time before she is or I am locked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to raise a family with Jane, someday. Someday.
    </p>
    <h3>Any <em>toys</em> for Jo?</h3>
    <p>
      Naah. I have never found <em>toys</em> any interesting. But I <strong>love</strong> the idea of distracting the mind, or challenging it. When I'm bored, <em>anything</em> within reach is like a toy. That is perhaps the one time I feel like a baby and do not mind it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It is okay.</strong>Pass the time. <strong>It'll be okay.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Sad to say bye. Hope to see you again!</h2>
    <p>Pay <a href="file:///home/benie/Desktop/moringa-school-projects/jo/jo.html">Jo's Chennel</a> a visit whenever you have spare time. I and my <em><strong>canine friends</strong></em> are always delighted to receive guests</p>
    <p>Also, don't always rush out. There is tons of stories here that you will love. But, well, if you must leave, good bye for now! Hope to see you again, <em>soon...</em></p>
